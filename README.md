# BoxParti

_Welcome to my first programming project._

_Enjoy!_

This was a project for a Scientific Computing Skills module in my Physics undergraduate. It is a Tkinter GUI running a **hard sphere molecular dynamics model simulation**.

I have noticed that this version **performes better on OS X**. With minor changes it can also run on Linux and Windows. 


### If running on Linux:
I have only tested this on Ubuntum. But the WelcomePage() class in [BoxParti.py](BoxParti.py) should only be using the **pack** or **grid** methods. This would actually be the correct way of doing it, according to Tkinter documentation! Some work to be done there...
